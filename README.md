Under construction still. I created the skeleton first, the project architecture, dependecies etc
Framework contains base classes, base repositories, base services, base controllers etc
Domain contains Entities and relevant things
Infrastructure contains the business logic part
WebApi contains the controllers and regarded endpoint and DTOs which need to be included on the API
